# 8858 'Doris' 2025 Codebase

This is the codebase for 8858 [Beast from the East]()'s 2025 robot named ['Doris'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_(Oceanid)).

In this code, we use the [YAGSL Library](https://docs.yagsl.com/) to implement a swerve drive as a starting point.
From there, we implement the compenents used for the [Penn State Ri3D](https://pennstateri3d.com/).
